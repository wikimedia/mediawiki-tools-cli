Custom docker-compose services

You can define you're own docker-compse file in a custom.yml file.
This file should be created in the directory returned by the `mw docker where` command.

Example regular service:
```yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  <service-name>:
    image: <service-image>
    dns:
      - 10.0.0.10
    networks:
      - dps
```

Example web service:
```yml
version: '3.7'
services:
  <service-name>:
    image: <service-image>
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=<service-name>.mwdd.localhost,<service-name>.mwdd
      - VIRTUAL_PORT=<service-port>
    depends_on:
      - nginx-proxy
    dns:
      - 10.0.0.10
    networks:
      - dps
```

Note: If you use the docker hosts file integration, you may need to manually add this host.
